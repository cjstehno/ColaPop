need to implement server states (val stored in session?)
need to perform defensive copies of msginfo when pulled from system (to protect delete changes)

	perhaps load messages into memory at login?
	how to "lock" message drop
	
	users
	userid, username, pass
	
	messages
	userid, uid, size, deleted, content (shoudl deleted just be a transactional prop?)
	
when session starts pull current messages into cached MsgInfo objects and lock out other access to that message box.
 * message numbers are determined by the ordering of the cached messages.
 * deletes are done to cached mess
 
when session ends push changes to db and unlock message box
